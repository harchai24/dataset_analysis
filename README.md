# dataset_analysis
The Python code I provided  covers all the tasks outlined in the original description, so it meets the requirements of :
Analyzing a Dataset's Basic Statistics. Here's a brief summary of how each task is addressed in the code:
Dataset Selection: The Iris dataset is chosen and loaded into Python using Pandas and scikit-learn.
Summary Statistics: The code calculates and displays the mean, median, and standard deviation for the numeric variables in the dataset.
Data Distribution: Histograms are created to visualize the distribution of the numeric variables.
Descriptive Analysis: While not explicitly mentioned in the code, this step can be considered completed by the visual and numerical summaries provided in the code comments.
Visualization: The code creates a bar chart to show the means for different variables, which serves as a summary visual representation of the dataset's basic statistics.
